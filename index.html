          Elon Musk was born on June 28th, 1971 in Pretoria, South Africa. After
          leaving University of Pennsylvania, Musk enrolled in Stanford
          University where he planned to study physics. After only 2 days in
          school, Musk dropped out in order to pursue technology as an
          occupation. In 1995, Musk founded Zip2, his first company. Zip2 was a
          a company that provided maps and business directories to online
          newspapers. Shortly after Zip2's launch, Musk sold the company to
          <a href="https://www.compaq.com/">Compaq</a> for $307 million. With
          that capital, Musk started X.com, which is now known as
          <a href="https://www.paypal.com/us/home">PayPal</a>. Again, shortly
          after Musk started PayPal,
          <a href="https://www.ebay.com/">eBay</a> bought the company for $1.5
          billion. Elon Musk is, so to speak, a space freak. Musk strongly
          believes that in order for humans to survive, humans must find other
          planets that ahve the ability to support human life. So, in 2002,
          after the sale of PayPal, Musk founded Space Exploration Technologies
          <a href="https://www.spacex.com/">(SpaceX)</a>. The goal of SpaceX is
          to make space exploration significantly more realistic while also
          making it a relatively inexpensive adventure. During SpaceX's
          development, Elon musk became an early stage investor in
          <a href="https://www.tesla.com/">Tesla</a>. Currently, Elon Musk
          resides as the CEO and product architect of the electric car company.
          Tesla's goal is to provide the world with vehicales that are not only
          relatively affordable, but also safe for the environment. The commpany
          also produces
          <a href="https://www.tesla.com/powerwall">home batteries</a> as well
          as <a href="https://www.tesla.com/solarpanels">solar panels</a>. In
          June 2010, Tesla Motors performed their intital public offering which
          has since sky rocketed in price, making Elon Musk one of the
          <a href="https://www.forbes.com/real-time-billionaires/#367960863d78"
            >wealthiest</a
          >
          people in the world. Musk is also famous for some of his lesser known
          companies such as
          <a href="https://www.boringcompany.com/">The Boring Company</a> and
          <a href="https://neuralink.com/">NeuraLink</a>. The Boring Company
          constructs safe, fast-to-dig, and low cost transportation, utility,
          and freight tunnels. NeuraLink is Musk's only medical company that is
          aimed at implanting wireless brain-computer software and hardware into
          human organs in order to help cure dibilitating diseases such as
